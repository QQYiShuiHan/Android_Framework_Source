/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} that executes each submitted task using
 * one of possibly several pooled threads, normally configured
 * using {@link Executors} factory methods.
 *
 * <p>Thread pools address two different problems: they usually
 * provide improved performance when executing large numbers of
 * asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation overhead,
 * and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources,
 * including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks.
 * Each {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} also maintains some basic
 * statistics, such as the number of completed tasks.
 *
 * <p>To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class
 * provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility
 * hooks. However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient
 * {@link Executors} factory methods {@link
 * Executors#newCachedThreadPool} (unbounded thread pool, with
 * automatic thread reclamation), {@link Executors#newFixedThreadPool}
 * (fixed size thread pool) and {@link
 * Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor} (single background thread), that
 * preconfigure settings for the most common usage
 * scenarios. Otherwise, use the following guide when manually
 * configuring and tuning this class:
 *
 * <dl>
 *
 * <dt>Core and maximum pool sizes</dt>
 *
 * <dd style="font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
 * A {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} will automatically adjust the
 * pool size (see {@link #getPoolSize})
 * according to the bounds set by
 * corePoolSize (see {@link #getCorePoolSize}) and
 * maximumPoolSize (see {@link #getMaximumPoolSize}).
 * <p>
 * When a new task is submitted in method {@link #execute(Runnable)},
 * and fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, a new thread is
 * created to handle the request, even if other worker threads are
 * idle.  If there are more than corePoolSize but less than
 * maximumPoolSize threads running, a new thread will be created only
 * if the queue is full.  By setting corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize
 * the same, you create a fixed-size thread pool. By setting
 * maximumPoolSize to an essentially unbounded value such as {@code
 * Integer.MAX_VALUE}, you allow the pool to accommodate an arbitrary
 * number of concurrent tasks. Most typically, core and maximum pool
 * sizes are set only upon construction, but they may also be changed
 * dynamically using {@link #setCorePoolSize} and {@link
 * #setMaximumPoolSize}. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>On-demand construction</dt>
 *
 * <dd style="font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
 * By default, even core threads are initially created and
 * started only when new tasks arrive, but this can be overridden
 * dynamically using method {@link #prestartCoreThread} or {@link
 * #prestartAllCoreThreads}.  You probably want to prestart threads if
 * you construct the pool with a non-empty queue. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Creating new threads</dt>
 *
 * <dd style="font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
 * New threads are created using a {@link ThreadFactory}.  If not
 * otherwise specified, a {@link Executors#defaultThreadFactory} is
 * used, that creates threads to all be in the same {@link
 * ThreadGroup} and with the same {@code NORM_PRIORITY} priority and
 * non-daemon status. By supplying a different ThreadFactory, you can
 * alter the thread's name, thread group, priority, daemon status,
 * etc. If a {@code ThreadFactory} fails to create a thread when asked
 * by returning null from {@code newThread}, the executor will
 * continue, but might not be able to execute any tasks. Threads
 * should possess the "modifyThread" {@code RuntimePermission}. If
 * worker threads or other threads using the pool do not possess this
 * permission, service may be degraded: configuration changes may not
 * take effect in a timely manner, and a shutdown pool may remain in a
 * state in which termination is possible but not completed.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Keep-alive times</dt>
 *
 * <dd style="font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
 * If the pool currently has more than corePoolSize threads,
 * excess threads will be terminated if they have been idle for more
 * than the keepAliveTime (see {@link #getKeepAliveTime(TimeUnit)}).
 * This provides a means of reducing resource consumption when the
 * pool is not being actively used. If the pool becomes more active
 * later, new threads will be constructed. This parameter can also be
 * changed dynamically using method {@link #setKeepAliveTime(long,
 * TimeUnit)}.  Using a value of {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} {@link
 * TimeUnit#NANOSECONDS} effectively disables idle threads from ever
 * terminating prior to shut down. By default, the keep-alive policy
 * applies only when there are more than corePoolSize threads, but
 * method {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)} can be used to
 * apply this time-out policy to core threads as well, so long as the
 * keepAliveTime value is non-zero. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Queuing</dt>
 *
 * <dd style="font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
 * Any {@link BlockingQueue} may be used to transfer and hold
 * submitted tasks.  The use of this queue interacts with pool sizing:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor
 * always prefers adding a new thread
 * rather than queuing.
 *
 * <li>If corePoolSize or more threads are running, the Executor
 * always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new
 * thread.
 *
 * <li>If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless
 * this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task will be
 * rejected.
 *
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There are three general strategies for queuing:
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li><em> Direct handoffs.</em> A good default choice for a work
 * queue is a {@link SynchronousQueue} that hands off tasks to threads
 * without otherwise holding them. Here, an attempt to queue a task
 * will fail if no threads are immediately available to run it, so a
 * new thread will be constructed. This policy avoids lockups when
 * handling sets of requests that might have internal dependencies.
 * Direct handoffs generally require unbounded maximumPoolSizes to
 * avoid rejection of new submitted tasks. This in turn admits the
 * possibility of unbounded thread growth when commands continue to
 * arrive on average faster than they can be processed.
 *
 * <li><em> Unbounded queues.</em> Using an unbounded queue (for
 * example a {@link LinkedBlockingQueue} without a predefined
 * capacity) will cause new tasks to wait in the queue when all
 * corePoolSize threads are busy. Thus, no more than corePoolSize
 * threads will ever be created. (And the value of the maximumPoolSize
 * therefore doesn't have any effect.)  This may be appropriate when
 * each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot
 * affect each others execution; for example, in a web page server.
 * While this style of queuing can be useful in smoothing out
 * transient bursts of requests, it admits the possibility of
 * unbounded work queue growth when commands continue to arrive on
 * average faster than they can be processed.
 *
 * <li><em>Bounded queues.</em> A bounded queue (for example, an
 * {@link ArrayBlockingQueue}) helps prevent resource exhaustion when
 * used with finite maximumPoolSizes, but can be more difficult to
 * tune and control.  Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes may be traded
 * off for each other: Using large queues and small pools minimizes
 * CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead, but can
 * lead to artificially low throughput.  If tasks frequently block (for
 * example if they are I/O bound), a system may be able to schedule
 * time for more threads than you otherwise allow. Use of small queues
 * generally requires larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but
 * may encounter unacceptable scheduling overhead, which also
 * decreases throughput.
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Rejected tasks</dt>
 *
 * <dd style="font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
 * New tasks submitted in method {@link #execute(Runnable)} will be
 * <em>rejected</em> when the Executor has been shut down, and also when
 * the Executor uses finite bounds for both maximum threads and work queue
 * capacity, and is saturated.  In either case, the {@code execute} method
 * invokes the {@link
 * RejectedExecutionHandler#rejectedExecution(Runnable, ThreadPoolExecutor)}
 * method of its {@link RejectedExecutionHandler}.  Four predefined handler
 * policies are provided:
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li>In the default {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy}, the
 * handler throws a runtime {@link RejectedExecutionException} upon
 * rejection.
 *
 * <li>In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy}, the thread
 * that invokes {@code execute} itself runs the task. This provides a
 * simple feedback control mechanism that will slow down the rate that
 * new tasks are submitted.
 *
 * <li>In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy}, a task that
 * cannot be executed is simply dropped.
 *
 * <li>In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy}, if the
 * executor is not shut down, the task at the head of the work queue
 * is dropped, and then execution is retried (which can fail again,
 * causing this to be repeated.)
 *
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * It is possible to define and use other kinds of {@link
 * RejectedExecutionHandler} classes. Doing so requires some care
 * especially when policies are designed to work only under particular
 * capacity or queuing policies. </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Hook methods</dt>
 *
 * <dd style="font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
 * This class provides {@code protected} overridable
 * {@link #beforeExecute(Thread, Runnable)} and
 * {@link #afterExecute(Runnable, Throwable)} methods that are called
 * before and after execution of each task.  These can be used to
 * manipulate the execution environment; for example, reinitializing
 * ThreadLocals, gathering statistics, or adding log entries.
 * Additionally, method {@link #terminated} can be overridden to perform
 * any special processing that needs to be done once the Executor has
 * fully terminated.
 *
 * <p>If hook, callback, or BlockingQueue methods throw exceptions,
 * internal worker threads may in turn fail, abruptly terminate, and
 * possibly be replaced.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Queue maintenance</dt>
 *
 * <dd style="font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
 * Method {@link #getQueue()} allows access to the work queue
 * for purposes of monitoring and debugging.  Use of this method for
 * any other purpose is strongly discouraged.  Two supplied methods,
 * {@link #remove(Runnable)} and {@link #purge} are available to
 * assist in storage reclamation when large numbers of queued tasks
 * become cancelled.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Finalization</dt>
 *
 * <dd style="font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
 * A pool that is no longer referenced in a program <em>AND</em>
 * has no remaining threads will be {@code shutdown} automatically. If
 * you would like to ensure that unreferenced pools are reclaimed even
 * if users forget to call {@link #shutdown}, then you must arrange
 * that unused threads eventually die, by setting appropriate
 * keep-alive times, using a lower bound of zero core threads and/or
 * setting {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)}.  </dd>
 *
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p><b>Extension example</b>. Most extensions of this class
 * override one or more of the protected hook methods. For example,
 * here is a subclass that adds a simple pause/resume feature:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class PausableThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor {
 *   private boolean isPaused;
 *   private ReentrantLock pauseLock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   private Condition unpaused = pauseLock.newCondition();
 *
 *   public PausableThreadPoolExecutor(...) { super(...); }
 *
 *   protected void beforeExecute(Thread t, Runnable r) {
 *     super.beforeExecute(t, r);
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       while (isPaused) unpaused.await();
 *     } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
 *       t.interrupt();
 *     } finally {
 *       pauseLock.unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public void pause() {
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       isPaused = true;

     * The main pool control state, ctl, is an atomic integer packing
     * two conceptual fields
     * workerCount, indicating the effective number of threads
     * runState,    indicating whether running, shutting down etc
     * <p>
     * In order to pack them into one int, we limit workerCount to
     * (2^29)-1 (about 500 million) threads rather than (2^31)-1 (2
     * billion) otherwise representable. If this is ever an issue in
     * the future, the variable can be changed to be an AtomicLong,
     * and the shift/mask constants below adjusted. But until the need
     * arises, this code is a bit faster and simpler using an int.
     * <p>
     * The workerCount is the number of workers that have been
     * permitted（允许） to start and not permitted to stop.  The value may be
     * transiently different from the actual number of live threads,
     * for example when a ThreadFactory fails to create a thread when
     * asked, and when exiting threads are still performing
     * bookkeeping before terminating. The user-visible pool size is
     * reported as the current size of the workers set.
     * <p>
     * The runState provides the main lifecycle control, taking on values:
     * <p>
     * RUNNING:  Accept new tasks and process queued tasks
     * SHUTDOWN: Don't accept new tasks, but process（处理） queued tasks
     * STOP:     Don't accept new tasks, don't process queued tasks,
     * and interrupt in-progress tasks
     * TIDYING:  All tasks have terminated, workerCount is zero,
     * the thread transitioning to state TIDYING
     * will run the terminated() hook method
     * TERMINATED: terminated() has completed
     * <p>
     * The numerical order among these values matters, to allow
     * ordered comparisons. The runState monotonically increases over
     * time, but need not hit each state. The transitions（转变） are:
     * <p>
     * RUNNING -> SHUTDOWN
     * On invocation（调用） of shutdown(), perhaps implicitly（隐式的） in finalize()
     * (RUNNING or SHUTDOWN) -> STOP
     * On invocation of shutdownNow()
     * SHUTDOWN -> TIDYING
     * When both queue and pool are empty
     * STOP -> TIDYING
     * When pool is empty
     * TIDYING -> TERMINATED
     * When the terminated() hook method has completed
     * <p>
     * Threads waiting in awaitTermination() will return when the
     * state reaches TERMINATED.
     * <p>
     * Detecting the transition from SHUTDOWN to TIDYING is less
     * straightforward than you'd like because the queue may become
     * empty after non-empty and vice versa during SHUTDOWN state, but
     * we can only terminate if, after seeing that it is empty, we see
     * that workerCount is 0 (which sometimes entails a recheck -- see

    /**
     * Main worker run loop.  Repeatedly gets tasks from queue and
     * executes them, while coping with a number of issues:
     * <p>
     * 1. We may start out with an initial task, in which case we
     * don't need to get the first one. Otherwise, as long as pool is
     * running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the
     * worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration
     * parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in
     * external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which
     * usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread.
     * <p>
     * 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent
     * other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and then we
     * ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have
     * its interrupt set.
     * <p>
     * 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which
     * might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die
     * (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing
     * the task.
     * <p>
     * 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task,
     * gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute.
     * We separately handle RuntimeException, Error (both of which the
     * specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables.
     * Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable.run, we
     * wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's
     * UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also
     * conservatively causes thread to die.
     * <p>
     * 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may
     * also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to
     * die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that
     * will be in effect even if task.run throws.
     * <p>
     * The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute
     * and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate
     * information as we can provide about any problems encountered by
     * user code.
     *

    /**
     * Executes the given task sometime in the future.  The task

     * <p>
     * If the task cannot be submitted for execution, either because this

     * the task is handled by the current {@code RejectedExecutionHandler}.
     *
     * newFixedThreadPool的execute方法执行过程：
     *      1，如果当前运行线程数少于corePoolSize，则创建新线程来执行任务（优先满足核心池）
     *      2，当前运行线程数等于corePoolSize时，将任务加入LinkedBlockingQueue链式阻塞队列（核心池满了在进入队列）
     *      3，当线程池的任务完成之后，循环反复从LinkedBlockingQueue队列中获取任务来执行
     * <p>
     * newSingleThreadExecutor的execute方法执行过程如下：
     *   1，当前运行的线程数少于corePoolSize（即当前线程池中午运行的线程），则创建一个新的线程来执行任务
     *   2，当线程池中有一个运行的线程时，将任务加入阻塞队列
     *   3，当线程完成任务时，会无限反复从链式阻塞队列中获取任务来执行
     * <p>
     * newCachedThreadPool是一个根据需要创建线程的线程池：
     * newCachedThreadPool的corePoolSize设置0，即核心池是空，maxmumPoolSize设置为Integer.MAX_VALUE,
     * 即maxmumPool是无界的。keepAliveTime设置60L,当空闲线程等待新任务最长时间是60s，超过60s就终止
     * <p>
     * 三个线程池的特点：
     * 1、newFixedThreadPool创建一个指定工作线程数量的线程池。每当提交一个任务就创建一个工作线程，
     *      如果工作线程数量达到线程池初始的最大数corePoolSize，则将提交的任务存入到池队列中。
     * 2、newCachedThreadPool创建一个可缓存的线程池。这种类型的线程池特点是：
     *       1).工作线程的创建数量几乎没有限制(其实也有限制的,数目为Interger. MAX_VALUE), 这样可灵活的往
     *          线程池中添加线程。
     *       2).如果长时间没有往线程池中提交任务，即如果工作线程空闲了指定的时间(默认为1分钟)，则该工作线程将
     *          自动终止。终止后，如果你又提交了新的任务，则线程池重新创建一个工作线程。
     *
     * 3、newSingleThreadExecutor创建一个单线程化的Executor，即只创建唯一的工作者线程来执行任务，
     *      如果这个线程异常结束，会有另一个取代它，保证顺序执行(我觉得这点是它的特色)。单工作线程最大的特点
     *      是可保证顺序地执行各个任务，并且在任意给定的时间不会有多个线程是活动的
     * <p>
     * 线程池的处理流程：
     *      1，首先线程池判断基本线程池是否已满（< corePoolSize ？）？没满，创建一个工作线程来执行任务。满了，则进入下个流程。
     *      2，其次线程池判断工作队列是否已满？没满，则将新提交的任务存储在工作队列里。满了，则进入下个流程。
     *      3，最后线程池判断整个线程池是否已满（< maximumPoolSize ？）？没满，则创建一个新的工作线程来执行任务，满了，则交给饱和策略来处理这个任务。
     * 总结：线程池优先要创建出基本线程池大小（corePoolSize）的线程数量，没有达到这个数量时，每次提交新任务都会
     *      直接创建一个新线程，当达到了基本线程数量后，又有新任务到达，优先放入等待队列，如果队列满了，才去创建新的
     *      线程（不能超过线程池的最大数maxmumPoolSize）
     * <p>
     * 向线程池提交任务的两种方式：
     * 1）通过execute()方法：
     *      这种方式提交没有返回值，也就不能判断任务是否被线程池执行成功。
     * 2）通过submit()方法：
     *      使用submit 方法来提交任务，它会返回一个Future对象，通过future的get方法来获取返回值，get方法会
     *      阻塞住直到任务完成，而使用get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)方法则会阻塞一段时间后立即返回，
     *      这时有可能任务没有执行完。
     *
     * 线程池的关闭：
     *      • shutdown()：不会立即终止线程池，而是再也不会接受新的任务，要等所有任务缓存队列中的任务都执行完后才终止
     *      • shutdownNow()：立即终止线程池，再也不会接受新的任务，并尝试打断正在执行的任务，并且清空任务缓存队列，返回尚未执行的任务
     *
